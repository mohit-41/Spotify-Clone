# Spotify-Clone
* I have created a client-side web app Audio Player. Its structure is taken from Spotify.
* It is fully responsive and compatible for every screen size. Responsiveness is added using media query from CSS.
* I have added some extra features like a media player on the Home Page and the left sidebar shows the lists of the songs for a particular playlist.
* The playbar has all the necessary features like play,pause,next,previous, volume control and time and duration control.
* The playlists are generated dynamically with the help of JavaScript DOM Manipulation.
* Here is a video walkthrough of the working web app:
